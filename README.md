### **Naughts and Crosses.**

#### General Assembly - SEI-31

The task was to build, from the ground up, a functioning game of noughts & crosses using a mix of the first 2 weeks' learned technologies; *HTML*, *CSS* & *JavaScript*.

I'd be lying if I said I found it easy. I pushed myself to try and have 2 separate *JS* files, one for DOM manipulation and another for the game logic.

You can find my functioning game here; https://trigotometry.github.io/project0/

I plan on refining the responsiveness, I'm not yet sure how I feel about Bulma over Bootstrap. Even though a number of posts have said the semantic approach it takes makes things easier to understand and guess, I'm not finding that with my own first attempt.
