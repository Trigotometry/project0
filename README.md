### **Naughts and Crosses.**

#### General Assembly - SEI-31

The task was to build, from the ground up, a functioning game of noughts and crosses using a mix of the first 2 weeks' learned technologies; *HTML*, *CSS* & *JavaScript*.

You can find my functioning game here; https://trigotometry.github.io/project0/
